## World ðŸŒŽ

## Dendron ðŸŒ±

### Our Mission

Dendron helps **humans** organize, reference, and work with any amount of knowledge.

### Our Product

We provide an open-source, local-first, markdown-based note-taking tool that helps developers work with notes like they do with code. Dendron borrows heavily from prior work in programming languages and developer tooling (which help developers organize and reference millions of lines of code) and applies the same principles to general knowledge. 

### Our North Star

From day one, the words of Vannevar Bush, originator of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), has been our north star 
> "We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

Our goal is to help humans take **command over the inherited knowledge of the ages**. We welcome you to be part of our journey :)
